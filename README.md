# Celestivo Events

Celestivo Events is a front-end web project developed as part of a web development mini-project. It showcases a simple yet elegant event management website designed to help users explore services and book events with ease.

## 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates my understanding of front-end development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The website is fully responsive and covers three major event categories:

- **Weddings**
- **Birthdays**
- **Naming Ceremonies**

Each event category has a dedicated page with a unique background and relevant content. The site includes a working "Book Now" button that opens a booking form for client registration.
